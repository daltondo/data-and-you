    "introduction":  "In a society that is increasingly placing importance on data-driven solutions, it is becoming more and more relevant to discuss the implications of data privacy and the use and misuse of data by large corporations. Large companies use data on their customers to understand key insights to effectively advertise and deliver better solutions that cater towards this customer. These increased data points, however, result in a decrease of privacy for customers as they leave an online trail for companies to chase after. The issue arises when this data is used beyond its intended purpose and actually takes value away from customers as corporations chase exorbitant profits and exploit their user base through data collection. Through this exhibition, we hope to highlight the idealist view of data use by corporations, the realities of the current day situation, and the potential future that could arise if we fail to question the current standard of data privacy and data collection. We hope to emphasize that data can have major benefits to both corporations and consumers in society but there needs to be a discussion on rebalancing the power dynamic between the two groups to empower consumers to take more control of their personal data. We encourage all viewers of this exhibit to think critically about the ideas presented and decide for themselves what makes data use ethical or unethical.",
